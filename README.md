This is a very quick and easy web app that I built to keep me motivated to continue studying.

Its basically just a collection of my study notes, as the name suggests.

Technologies used:
- Svelte (for the front-end framework)
- Firebase (for the database and hosting service)
- StackEdit (for the beautiful html documents)
